In general, long-short equity strategies consist of modeling the relative value of assets with respect to each other, and placing bets on the sets of assets that we are confident will increase ([long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp)) and decrease ([short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp)) the most in value.  \n",
